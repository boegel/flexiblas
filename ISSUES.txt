1. Profiling Numpy/Scipy with linked against FlexiBLAS 
------------------------------------------------------
Due to the default behaviour of Python to open C-API modules with LAZY and local
binding, not all FlexiBLAS related symbols are integrated correctly in the
current address space. The profiling will not count all function calls
correctly. Many of them will be passed directly to the loaded backend bypassing
the wrapper interface. Changing Python's default behaviour using
sys.setdlopenflags may help in this case but it is not guaranteed. 

Solution: Compile and link Numpy/SciPy and all related packages against
fleixblas-profile and load flexiblas-profile again via LD_PRELOAD.
