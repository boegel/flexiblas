Description: Development files for libflexiblas.
 The FlexiBLAS library is a flexible BLAS wrapper 
 which allows one to exchange the system wide BLAS 
 implementation without recompiling or relinking programs. 
 Even dealing with runtime-loader specific tricks is 
 not necessary with FlexiBLAS. 
 .
 You can select the BLAS implementation which is used behind 
 FlexiBLAS using a configuration file or a environment variable. 
 It is integrated in Debian/Ubuntu using the update-alternatives 
 mechanism.
 .
 The package supports OpenBLAS, ATLAS and the reference Netlib 
 implementation. If you compile FlexiBLAS on your own, other 
 BLAS implementations like the old GotoBLAS or the Intel MKL 
 are supported. 
 .
 This package contains the development files.
